# Dropbox-1.0
Finished the UI, have it updating when files are sent in and able to click on them to download.

TODO- if I have time later/ can be bothered
- if the same files are sent in they get appended onto the download list, even though there is already one existing there
- consider changing the download button to a download box to be able to drop files into 
- consider adding a delete button
